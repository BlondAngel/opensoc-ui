## Dependencies

### Using Vagrant

The quickest way to get up and running by far is with Vagrant. Download and install the following:

1. [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

After that's done, assuming you're inside the root directory of this project, just run

```vagrant up```

which will download and provision the VM for you.
